// that would require Amazon implement over 100 marketplaces, and we have auth to use all of them.

// FURTHER TODO: how smart can we make our framework? can we handle multiple requests
// to any endpoint that returns a NextToken ?
// EVEN FURTHER TODO: can we handle rate limiting, while we're doing that, and only
// return results when we get all the data?
